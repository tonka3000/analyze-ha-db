The notebook can be used analyze a copy of the Home Assistant sqlite database to ...

- Get the states with the most updates
- Get the events counts

This data can be used to exclude certain entities in the [Home Assistant recorder](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/recorder/#configure-filter) to reduce the amount of data which is stored in the database to keep it efficient.

More information about the process can be found in the excellent [post from Denilson S√° Maia](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/how-to-keep-your-recorder-database-size-under-control/295795).
Also most of the SQL queries from the post are used in this notebook.

Thank you [Denilson S√° Maia](https://github.com/denilsonsa) for the great work üôè
